abstract = {Abstract Despite the significant effects of agricultural pest management on crop yield, profit, environmental quality, and sustainability, farmers oftentimes lack data-driven decision support to help optimize pest management strategies. To address this need, we curated a comprehensive data set that consists of pest, pest management, and yield information from 1498 commercial cotton crops in California's San Joaquin Valley between 1997 and 2008. Using this data set, we built a Markov decision process model to identify the optimal management policy of a key cotton pest, Lygus hesperus, that balances the tradeoff between yield loss and the cost of pesticide applications. Our results show that pesticide applications targeting L. hesperus are only economically optimal during the first 2 weeks of June, and pesticide applications were associated with increased risk of an unprofitable harvest. About 46\% of the observations in our data set involved at least one pesticide application outside of this optimal window, demonstrating the need for a data-driven approach to crop management. Sensitivity analyses on parameter perturbations and reduced data set sizes suggest that our methodology provides a robust policy-making tool, even in noisy data sets.}

abstract="Recent analyses demonstrate that the spatial--temporal behavior of invasive species requires optimal management decisions over space and time. From a spatial perspective, this bioeconomic optimization model broadens away from invasive species spread at a frontier or to neighbors by examining short and long-distance dispersal, directionality in spread, and network geometry. In terms of uncertainty and dynamics, this framework incorporates several sources of stochasticity, decisions with multi-year implications, and temporal ecological processes. This paper employs a unique Markov decision process planning algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic system to explore the spatial-dynamic optimal policy for a river network facing a bioinvasion, with Tamarisk as an example. In addition to exploring the spatial, stochastic, and dynamic aspects of management of invasions, the results demonstrate how the interaction of spatial and multi-period processes contributes to finding the optimal policy. Those interactions prove critical in determining the right management tool, in the right location, at the right time, which informs the management implications drawn from simpler frameworks. In particular, as compared to other modeling framework's policy prescriptions, the framework here finds more use of the management tool restoration and more management in highly connected locations, which leads to a less invaded system over time.",

abstract = {Summary Spatial management of invasive species is more likely to be successful when multiple locations are treated simultaneously. However, selecting the best locations to act is difficult due to the many options available at any time. We design a near-optimal policy for applying multiple actions simultaneously for faster invasive species control within a network. Our method uses a recent optimisation tool, the graph-based Markov decision process (GMDP). Since the policy can be difficult to interpret, we extracted a simpler policy using classification trees. We applied our approach to the eradication of invasive mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki from the habitat of the red-finned blue-eye Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis, a critically endangered fish with a global population that is restricted to seven artesian springs in Queensland, Australia. The policy returned by the GMDP was to manage springs occupied by mosquitofish and their connected neighbours, unless the neighbours were occupied by red-finned blue-eyes. Simultaneous management resulted in rapid declines in simulated mosquitofish occupancy even if eradication effectiveness was low; however, the cost of simultaneous eradication was high and sustained eradication effort was necessary to maintain low mosquitofish occupancy. Synthesis and applications. Our paper finds a near-optimal, multi-action control policy to remove an invasive species from a multi-species spatial network. We introduce the graph-based Markov decision process and apply it to a real case study – eradication of invasive mosquitofish from the habitat of the red-finned blue-eye. We find that the graph-based Markov decision process can generate policies for networks with extremely large state spaces; however, it works best when nodes have fewer than five neighbours. We conclude that simultaneous eradications are effective for rapid control of invasive species; however, managers should consider the cost and time required for an effective eradication program.}
